ALADIN-M - a toolbox for distributed non-convex optimization in MALTAB with  [ALADIN](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/140975991) and ADMM.

## Highlights
ALADIN-M 
- supports general partially separable NLPs;
- provides a unified interface for ALADIN and ADMM and a centralized solver for direct comparison;
- supports parallel computing;
- comes with a rich set of examples from power systems, estimation and control;
- (is runnable with Octave.)

with extensions including a set of application examples from different engineering fields.


## Requirements:
- [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) 
- MATLAB [parallel computing toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html) (for parallel computing)
- MATLAB [symbolic math toolbox](https://de.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html) (only for the examples)
